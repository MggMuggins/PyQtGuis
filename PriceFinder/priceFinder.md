# PriceFinder
This is a QtGui I built for the LOTR Minecraft Mod wiki, for finding the correct price range given a price from in-game. Campinator made a D program to do the same thing, but he suggested I do a PyQt project for it.

## Todo
* Make Algorithm work
* Check with wiki users for requested features

# PyQt Guis
This is my repository for all my little PyQt projects. If I decide to make something really fancy (which I doubt), I'll put it in it's own repo, but these are so small they don't deserve their own. However, I do want them on github. Contact me with questions!

## Use Cases
### Running
To run any of these programs, you need PyQt5, and Python 3.x. Install pip3 (the python package manager) on your computer, and then run ```pip3 install pyqt5```. This should deal with all your dependencies. To run any of these programs, use ```python3 <filename>```.
### Contributing
If anyone would like to contribute, feel free! I don't much care what you do with these programs, so feel free to fork and PR to your heart's content. If your code works, I'll most likely accept your PR. If you have seriously iffy code that we'll need to hack on to make nice, please open a new branch. I'll still accept the PR.
